Game - Shut the Box

The game is played using a box with nine numbers (from 1 to 9), which can be
turned up and down. All numbers are turned up to start. Additionally, two dice
are needed. Players take turns playing the game.

Player 1 starts his turn by throwing the two dice, and sums up the values of the
dice (for example, in the image above, the player threw 1 and 3, so the sum is
4. He now has to turn down 1 or 2 blocks which have the same sum as the
sum of the dice (for example, in the image above, the player can only turn
down the block with number 4; if 1 and 3 were still up, he would be able to turn
those down instead of number 4). The player continues throwing the dice and
turning down block(s), until he cannot turn down any more blocks (i.e.,
because he cannot turn down blocks with the sum equal as the sum of his
dice). If at any point in the game, the sum of the remaining blocks is 6 or lower,
the player only throws 1 die, instead of 2. At the end of his turn, the score is
the sum of the blocks still turned up.

Now, player 2 starts his turn. All blocks are turned up again, and player 2
proceeds in exactly the same way as player 1.

The player with the lowest score wins.
